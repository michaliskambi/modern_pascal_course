This repository contains the examples from the course.

- They've all been tested with Delphi 12.

- Most of them should work with any Delphi or FPC versions, with minimal mods (for FPC, add `{$ifdef FPC} {$mode delphi} {$endif}` to the top of the file), through this was not tested.

- Some of them contain Polish comments or identifiers. TODO: eventually translate them to English.
